# ToDoList

I have made this todo list with back end integration. So the list of items will be there when you reopen the page or reload the page.

I have used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Nodejs, express, mySQL

HOW TO USE
enter the task and press the add button and it will be listed inside the box.
if you click on the task a strike will appear.
if you double click in a task the task will be removed and deleted from the database too.
